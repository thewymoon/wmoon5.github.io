  <div class="post-content" itemprop="articleBody">
    <p>It’s the start of a new year and new semester at universities everywhere. And what does that mean? Crowded gyms.</p>

<p>Many of us have experienced the frustration of walking into a crowded gym and all of its associated negative consequences. If you’re like me, you may end up even resorting to going to the gym close to midnight in order to avoid long waits. And though the gym does seem to be less crowded at these late hours, it comes at the cost of having a very hard time falling asleep at night. Still worth it to me.</p>

<p>Today we’ll look to find a better way to decide when to hit the gym so that you and I can look and feel as good as possible while minimizing our crowded gym frustrations. I have taken a <a href="https://www.kaggle.com/nsrose7224/crowdedness-at-the-campus-gym">dataset</a> from the kaggle website, in which the number of people at a university gym has been recorded at various time intervals throughout the year.</p>

<p>First, let’s take a look at the average gym numbers throughout the day.</p>

<p><img src="https://github.com/wmoon5/wmoon5.github.io/blob/master/images/gym_crowds/overall_average.png?raw=true" alt="Gym crowdes throughout day" /></p>

<p>We can notice a few things:</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p>Numbers at the gym seem to start dipping around 10 PM</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The gym is relatively empty in the mornings, but you probably want to finish your workout by 8 AM  on the weekdays and 9 AM on the weekends</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There’s a noticeable dip around 2 PM possibly due to people finishing up and leaving after a mid-day workout during their lunch hours</p>
  </li>
</ol>

<p>Most likely it’s these two pieces of information (the time and whether it is the weekend or weekday) that make up the vast majority of our thought process when deciding about going to the gym. So, let’s measure how accurate we can be using this method. By measuring the average number of people at the gym for each 15 minute interval of the day for both weekdays and weekends, a prediction about the gym crowd can be made given the time of day and whether it is the weekend or not.</p>

<p>It’s very important to remember to split your data into a “training set” and “test set” when measuring the performance of a predictor, so I make sure to do that here. Otherwise it’s almost like a teacher putting the exact some questions from past homeworks on a test. The test is meant to measure how well a student knows the material, but if questions are reused from previous homeworks, then students can simply remember the answers without necessarily actually understanding the material.</p>

<p>So how well does this method perform? We can calculate the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mean_squared_error">mean squared error (MSE)</a> and return a value of <strong>12.6</strong>, meaning our prediction using this method will generally be wrong by about 12.6 people (on average).</p>

<p>This seems alright, but I hope to do better by incorporating some more information and using a machine learning algorithm called <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gradient_boosting">Gradient Boosted</a> Decision Trees (BDT). I won’t go into the details of how they work right now (that’s for another post), but we will look at some results. The features used to make the predictions are as follows:</p>

<ol>
  <li>The time of day</li>
  <li>Day of the week</li>
  <li>Whether it is a holiday</li>
  <li>The temperature</li>
  <li>Whether it is the beginning of the semester</li>
</ol>

<p>And how well does this method perform?? The MSE comes out to around <strong>7.8</strong>, which is a significant improvement over our previous method.</p>

<p>It turns out that we can actually look at how important the different features are for the BDT to make its predictions. Here we can see a plot of the different features in order of decreasing importance.</p>

<p><img src="https://github.com/wmoon5/wmoon5.github.io/blob/master/images/gym_crowds/FeatureImportances.png?raw=true" alt="Feature Importances" /></p>

<p>Interestingly, the temperature is the most important feature and not the time! But just knowing that the temperature is important doesn’t really help us that much. We want to know <em>how</em> it is affecting the gym crowd. It turns out there are cool plots called <a href="http://scikit-learn.org/stable/auto_examples/ensemble/plot_partial_dependence.html">partial dependence</a> plots that help us interpret what the BDT is doing with the temperature information.</p>

<p><img src="https://github.com/wmoon5/wmoon5.github.io/blob/master/images/gym_crowds/TempPartialDependence.png?raw=true" alt="Temperature Partial Dependence" /></p>

<p>We can interpret these plots like this. The horizontal x-axis tells us the temperature and the vertical y-axis tells us the relative affect that a given temperature has on the final prediction of the BDT. For example, we can see that at a cold temperature of 50 degrees, the line is at -10 on the y-axis. This means that the BDT sees that it is cold and will generally reduce its prediction by about 10 people because of the temperature. It’s worth noting that these are all statements regarding only averages and average effects, but they nonetheless give us an idea of what the BDT is doing.</p>

<p>And fortunately enough the temperature partial dependence plot affirms what many of us probably already know intuitively. Cold temperatures dissuade people from leaving their home and going to the gym.</p>

<p>So, there you have it! A cute little analysis of gym crowds. To recap what we’ve learned:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Morning workouts should be done before 8 AM on weekdays and 9 AM on weekends</li>
  <li>The gym starts clearing up around 10 PM</li>
  <li>It’s generally less crowded overall on the weekends</li>
  <li>The weather plays a large role and the best times to go are when it’s too cold</li>
</ol>

<p>Enjoy your workout!</p>
