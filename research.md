Interests
---------
My interests lie at the crossroads between physics, math, and medicine. I have spent a lot of time trying different things and have found a very happy home applying my background in physics to the complicated world of biology. 

Computational Biology and Genomics
----------------------------------
My work is focused on applying methods from various fields including statistics, machine learning, physics, and graph theory on tough questions in cancer genomics. Currently I am working on building and interpreting models to predict the binding of transcription factors to specific parts of our DNA. 

**The big question: how in the world do transcription factors know where in the genome to go and bind?**

Particle Physics
-----------------
As part of the [ATLAS](http://atlas.cern) collaboration based at [CERN](https://home.cern), I built a Boosted Decision Tree model used to look for extremely rare "exotic Higgs" decay events. This was my first experience with machine learning and have been fascinated ever since. I also had the chance to dip my toe into the world of FPGA's as I helped write firmware that will be used in an upcoming upgrade to the ATLAS muon detectors.
