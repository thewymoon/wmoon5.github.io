Interests
---------
My interests lie at the intersection between physics, math, and medicine. I have spent some time trying different things and have found a very happy home applying my background in physics to the interesting world of biology. 

Computational Biology and Genomics
----------------------------------
My work is focused on applying methods from various fields including statistics, machine learning, physics, and graph theory on questions in cancer genomics. Currently I am working on building and interpreting models to predict the binding of transcription factors to specific parts of our DNA. 


Particle Physics
-----------------
As part of the [ATLAS](http://atlas.cern) collaboration based at [CERN](https://home.cern), I built a Boosted Decision Tree model used to look for extremely rare (if they even exist at all) "exotic Higgs" decay events. This was my first experience with machine learning and have been fascinated ever since. I also had the chance to dip my toe into the world of FPGA's as I helped write firmware that will be used in an upcoming upgrade to the ATLAS muon detectors.
