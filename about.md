Hi! I'm an Applied Scientist at Amazon, working at the intersection of machine learning, engineering, and the life sciences! I received a PhD from the physics program at the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign, working with [Jun Song](http://song.igb.illinois.edu), where we used statistical learning and other fun techniques to study cancer genomics.

Previously, I worked in particle physics as part of the ATLAS collaboration with [Verena Martinez-Outschoorn](http://research.physics.illinois.edu/martinez/). And prior to coming to UIUC, I received my Bachelor's degree at Brown University, where I worked in [Derek Stein's](https://vivo.brown.edu/display/ds1) condensed matter and biophysics lab.
