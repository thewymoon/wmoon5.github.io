Here's something I've wondered about for a while. 

When it comes to basketball, I always hear coaches and players say things along the lines of *"the team that gets the most rebounds wins"* implying that if you want to win a game, you should really focus on outrebounding the other team. 
And while I certainly don't doubt that poor rebounding will definitely reduce your chances of winning a basketball game, I wonder if there is another way to interpret the observation that it seems like the team with the most rebounds usually wins the game.
If we assume that defensive rebounds are easier to get than offensive rebounds, aren't rebounding numbers largely just a function of the number of missed field goal attempts by the opposing team? And in that case, is the statement about rebounding and winning games just an indirect way of saying the more trivial statement that the team that misses the most shots usually loses?

In other words, if Team A misses more shots than Team B, then Team B will have more opportunities to grab defensive rebounds off those missed shots and thus be more likely to have more rebounds at the end of the game than Team A. In this case, doesn't it seem like the reason for Team B's victory is the fewer missed shots rather than the greater number of rebounds? 

In statistical terms, I am wondering if rebounding is more of a [confounding](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Confounding) factor than anything else.

I look to explore this question using some data I scraped from the fabulously fun [stats.nba.com](//stats.nba.com).

First, it's always fun to look at some correlations:
