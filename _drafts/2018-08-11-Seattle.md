People say summers in Seattle are incredible and now that I've experienced one myself, I'm going to start being one of those people.
For those who didn't already know, I spent 12 weeks in Seattle working at Redfin, a real-estate brokerage that relies heavily on technology, as a data science intern. 
It has truly been an eye-opening experience in many ways and I wanted to share a few thoughts about my time here.

I'll be splitting my thoughts into two posts. The first will be about Seattle the city and the second will be about my time working with Redfin. 
To be clear, by no means do I consider myself an expert on anything I'll be writing about.
And with that, let me tell you about my summer in Seattle:
