Those who know me know that I'm a huge basketball fan. And now that my playing days are over, I have transitioned from playing basketball to the even more exciting activity of analyzing basketball data.

I'll be writing my first blog post on one of basketball's greatest icons, Kobe Bryant. Considered one of the greatest and most popular players to every play the game, he is particularly interesting because of his ability to stay dominant for so many years. He was able to do so, not only by being gifted with great genes, but also by changing his style of play throughout his career to adjust to the changes in the NBA, his teammates, and his own body. 

For the sake of this post, I will divide Kobe's career into five different eras. First, we call the first three years of Kobe's career as the ["Young Kobe"](https://i.ytimg.com/vi/eaJMLnt5bdU/maxresdefault.jpg) era, which is followed by the ["Frobe"](https://static1.squarespace.com/static/564173e3e4b047c0f3f64775/t/570e96fd27d4bd2e542dfb32/1460573954240/) era, during which Kobe rocked his famous afro. After that we have the ["Solo Kobe"](http://s3.amazonaws.com/tpt-uploads-production/uploads/56704175-copy-3-e1453399062311.jpg) during which he had his historical 81 point game. Then we have ["Black Mamba"](http://www.rantsports.com/nba/files/2015/03/Kobe-Bryant.jpg) followed by ["Vino"](http://i.cdn.turner.com/nba/nba/.element/media/2.0/teamsites/lakers/images/press/1213_allstar/ts_010103allstar670.jpg) Kobe. (These names and eras were inspired by a reddit post I read a while ago)

First let us take a look at his shooting percentages from different distances during each of these eras.
