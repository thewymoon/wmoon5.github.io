As my days in grad school come to an end, I can't help but reflect a bit on the last six years of my life. As I sit alone in my apartment and explore my feelings about my time here, I recognize two major emotions: pride and gratitude.

#### Pride:
I'll admit it. I'm proud of myself. I'm proud that I was able to get through the really low, dark, and aimless moments of grad school. I'm proud that I came into grad school having never taken a computer science or statistics class and now find myself reasonably proficient at those things. And I'm proud of the hard work that I've put in. I've stretched myself and pushed my own personal limitations in ways that make me happy to think back on. It feels nice to work hard sometimes.

#### Gratitude:
More importantly, I feel so thankful. I'm tremendously thankful for the friends that I made here. To be honest, I didn't even really make much of an effort to make friends at first, but I somehow got lucky and found myself plugged into a really great group of people. I'm thankful that the department supported me when I was considering applying to medical school. I'm thankful for the opportunity to work at CERN and travel Europe. I'm thankful that I was able to eventually find a line of research that not only aligned with my interests, but also my career goals. I'm thankful for a supportive advisor who offered me the freedom to pursue the things that I wanted. I'm thankful for the financial support during my time here. I'm thankful for a great landlord. I'm thankful for my cat, Mango. I'm thankful for the support of my family. 

#### Departing Words:
My time in grad school has been one of growth. I've become more confident in myself as a student, researcher, and adult human being. And I'll truly miss Champaign. It isn't perfect, but it's the place where I've made some of my best friends, made some of my favorite memories, and became a doctor, just not the kind that saves lives.
